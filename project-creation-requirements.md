# Product Requirements Document: Concise MCP Example Server

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a concise example MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that adheres to the latest MCP standards. This server will demonstrate the use of the FastMCP package and provide a simple tool call demonstrating a mathematical operation. It will be easy to deploy and launch using the UV package manager, with seamless VS Code integration after a git checkout.

## Clarifications

### Functional Requirements

1. **MCP Server Implementation**
   - It should be built so that it can be cloned from git and immediately used with VS Code and UV without additional setup.
   - The project should use UV for dependency management and execution, making it portable and reproducible across environments.
   - The server must be implemented in Python 3.13, ensuring compatibility with the latest MCP standards as of May 2025.
   - Use the FastMCP 2.0 or later package (current version v2.2.7 as of May 2025) to build the server, leveraging its high-level Pythonic interface for MCP server creation.
   - Install FastMCP using `uv pip install fastmcp` as recommended in the official documentation.
   - FastMCP server should be created using the Pythonic decorator-based syntax for tools.
   - Use stdio transport exclusively, which is ideal for direct integration with model providers and simple testing.
   - Configure the server to run with stdio transport, making it easier to pipe input and output directly to and from the server.
   - Implement the server with the recommended `if __name__ == "__main__":` block pattern for maximum compatibility with all MCP clients.
   - Follow the FastMCP best practice where each server runs in its own process, allowing clients to manage multiple servers independently.

2. **VS Code Integration**
   - Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration file to enable VS Code to interact with the MCP server.
   - Configure the `mcp.json` file to use UV for launching the server with stdio transport.
   - Ensure that after cloning the repository, a user only needs to have UV installed to use the server within VS Code.
   - Follow the standard MCP configuration format:
     ```json
     {
       "servers": {
         "math-server": {
           "type": "stdio",
           "command": "uv",
           "args": ["run", "python", "-m", "simple.server"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Ensure the configuration works with VS Code's MCP support, allowing the tools to be used in agent mode.
   - Include documentation on how to start, stop, and interact with the server through VS Code's interface.

3. **Mathematical Tools**
   - Include tools for basic mathematical operations, starting with an addition tool that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
   - Implement the tool using FastMCP's decorator syntax as shown in their examples (`@mcp.tool()`).

4. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the MCP server's functionality, correctness of tool calls, and edge cases for mathematical operations.
   - Utilize FastMCP's testing utilities for stdio transport to validate input and output streams.
   - Create tests that simulate model requests and verify proper responses from the server.
   - Mock stdin/stdout to test server communication specifically for stdio transport.
   - Verify proper handling of tool invocations through stdio streams, including error handling and response formatting.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Ease of Deployment**
   - Utilize the UV Astral package manager to simplify deployment and launching of the server.
   - Ensure the project can be cloned and used immediately with minimal setup steps.
   - Support multiple ways to run the server as recommended in the FastMCP documentation:
     - Development mode: `uv run fastmcp dev server.py`
     - CLI mode: `uv run fastmcp run server.py:mcp_server --transport stdio`
     - Directly with Python: `uv run python -m simple.server`
   - Configure and use stdio transport mechanism:
     - stdio: For direct integration with model providers through standard input/output streams
     - Include examples of piping input to the server and processing its output
   - Ensure the server is designed to handle the stdio transport behavior where:
     - The client starts a new server process for each session
     - Communication happens through standard input/output streams
     - The server process terminates when the client disconnects

2. **Documentation**
   - Provide clear and concise documentation covering:
     - Steps to clone and set up the server with UV.
     - Instructions for VS Code integration after git checkout.
     - Instructions for using the mathematical tools.
     - Guidelines for running the tests with UV.
     - stdio transport configuration options.
     - Links to the official FastMCP GitHub repository for reference.

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Use the UV Astral package manager for managing project dependencies and virtual environments.
   - Include a pyproject.toml file for modern Python packaging and dependency specification.
   - Ensure compatibility with Linux, macOS, and Windows for cross-platform development.
   - Leverage UV's features for lockfile management, reproducible resolutions, and efficient dependency deduplication.

## Development Steps

1. **Setup**
   - Initialize a Python project.
   - Install the FastMCP package using UV: `uv pip install fastmcp`

2. **Server Development**
   - Create the MCP server using FastMCP's Pythonic interface:
     ```python
     from fastmcp import FastMCP
     
     mcp = FastMCP("Math Server ðŸ§®")
     
     @mcp.tool()
     def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
         """Add two numbers together"""
         return a + b
         
     if __name__ == "__main__":
         # Run with stdio transport
         mcp.run(transport="stdio")
     ```
   - Implement additional mathematical tools if needed.

3. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests to validate the MCP server's functionality, correctness of tool calls, and edge cases for mathematical operations.
   - Create tests that validate input and output with stdio transport:
     - Mock stdin/stdout to test server communication
     - Verify proper handling of tool invocations through stdio streams
     - Test error handling and response formatting
   - Use FastMCP's testing utilities to validate MCP compliance.
   - Test direct server execution with stdin/stdout:
     - `echo '{"type":"tool_call","name":"add","parameters":{"a":1,"b":2}}' | python simple/server.py`
     - Verify correct JSON response to stdio

4. **Documentation**
   - Write setup and usage instructions.
   - Document the testing process.
   - Include details on stdio transport options and their configuration.
   - Include links to FastMCP documentation.
   - Provide examples of command-line usage with stdio.

5. **Deployment**
   - Configure the UV Astral package manager for deployment.
   - Test the deployment process.
   - Document different server run options with stdio transport.
   - Provide instructions for piping input/output to and from the server.

6. **UV Installation**
   - Install UV on Linux using the standalone installer:
     ```bash
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - Alternatively, install UV via pip:
     ```bash
     pip install uv
     ```
   - Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     uv --version
     ```
